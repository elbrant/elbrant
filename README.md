### Hi :)

I am a self-taught Programmer, Web Deveoper, coder, creator, and envisionist, who is hyperfocused on the Internet. I am currently collecting an assortment of online tutorial certifications for things I did professionally in 1996. Even with a hiatus, well, it's been a minute. 

I am developing a new <!-- [elbrant.net](https://elbrant.net) --> webiste outlining my portfolio, skill sets, and side-gigs that are available via other platforms. I'm staying busy. But secretly, I would really like to pay down my VISA ... 

So, *if there is something you need to get done*, big or, small. <a href="mailto:elbrant@yahoo.com">**Get in touch**</a>, I'll get it done.
